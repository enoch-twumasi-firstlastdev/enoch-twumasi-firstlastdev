## My Anchor: THE FIRST AND THE LAST
I am a **Seventh-day Adventist Christian**. To me, GOD’s WORDS are the most precious knowledge in existence.THEY are more than knowledge, as JESUS revealed, THEY are **spirit** and **life**. GOD's WORD is TRUTH as JESUS said. I deeply cherish the **Sabbath**, a wonderful time to raise affection from earth to things above; To rest in HIS presence and honor HIS work as THE CREATOR of all things. 

Everything I build is by **HIS Grace** and for **THE GLORY of THE ONE TRUE GOD**. The brand name "First and Last" is a memorial to HIS NAME: 
> *"I am the First and I am the Last; beside Me there is no god."* — **Isaiah 44:6**

## Scientific Precision x Technical Grit
My journey into web development and IT didn't start in a bootcamp; it started in Grade 7 with **Mr. Famous**, who by GOD's Grace instilled in me the precision required for computer science. 

My path through **General Science, Forest Resources Technology,Biological Sciences and Biomedical Sciences** taught me that digital systems—like biological ones—demand exactness. By GOD’s grace, that discipline transferred to engineering high-performance digital architecture.

### The Bread Delivery Days
This agency was born from prayer and fueled by grit. During college breaks, I spent my nights coding my first professional sites and my mornings delivering bread for my mother—literally dozing off at customers' gates from pure exhaustion. By GOD's Grace that grit is now baked into every line of code at **First and Last**.
